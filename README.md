AES Decryption
==============

AES Decryption is a (surprise!) tool that decrypts files encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard. More specifically, it likes files that use aes-256-cbc and that are encoded in Base64. It is also very AESthetically pleasing.

The actual decryption is done on the client side using [CryptoJS][].

Usage
-----

Your best bet to create a file that will work with AES Descryption is OpenSSL:

    $ openssl aes-256-cbc -base64 -in secrets -out secrets.aes

Use a strong [passphrase][pass] and then store this file somewhere on the web (e.g. Dropbox). Fire up [AES Decryption][aes], enter in the URL and passhrase, and click the decrypt button.
